# AWS Amplify Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account with Amplify access
- GitHub repository with admin panel code
- Production API backend running at `https://api.nungudiamonds.co.za`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect Repository to AWS Amplify

1. Go to AWS Amplify Console
2. Click "New app" â†’ "Host web app"
3. Choose GitHub as source
4. Select your repository and branch (main/master)
5. Configure build settings

### 2. Build Settings

The `amplify.yml` file is already configured with:
- Node.js environment
- npm ci for dependency installation
- npm run build for building the app
- Proper caching for node_modules and .next

### 3. Environment Variables

In the Amplify Console, add these environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.nungudiamonds.co.za/api/v2/
NEXT_PUBLIC_REST_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.nungudiamonds.co.za/api/v2
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMG_ENDPOINT=https://d2yhu6nvl7lle6.cloudfront.net
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=PUBLIC_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN
CRYPTO_JS_KEY=d54g32sgrdd5r84gs134g8ees13ds56g
CRYPTO_JS_IV=f4g536g4s3d3r8r64s2sa35jj8ki8ufg
```

### 4. Build Configuration

The build will:
- Install dependencies with `npm ci`
- Build the Next.js application
- Output to `.next` directory
- Cache node_modules and build cache for faster subsequent builds

### 5. Domain Configuration (Optional)

1. In Amplify Console, go to "Domain management"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed
4. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned

### 6. Deployment

1. Commit and push your changes to the connected branch
2. Amplify will automatically trigger a build
3. Monitor the build process in the Amplify Console
4. Once complete, your admin panel will be live

## Build Optimizations

- **Standalone output**: Configured for better performance
- **Image optimization**: Disabled for compatibility with CDN
- **Caching**: Enabled for faster builds
- **ESLint**: Configured to not block builds

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure API endpoints are accessible
- Review build logs in Amplify Console

### Runtime Issues
- Verify API endpoints are correct
- Check CORS settings on backend
- Ensure CDN URLs are accessible

## Security Notes

- Environment variables containing sensitive data should be managed through Amplify Console
- The `.env.production` file is excluded from git for security
- API tokens should be rotated regularly

## Monitoring

- Use Amplify Console for build and deployment monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch for application monitoring
- Configure alerts for build failures
